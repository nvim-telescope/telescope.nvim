---@tag telescope.actions.utils

---@brief [[
--- Utilities to wrap actions and functions around picker selections and entries.
--- Generally used with other |telescope.actions| or custom functions that lever entries or selections.
---
--- The functions without the `_` prefix are intended to be mapped at setup, whereas `functions` with the `_` prefix
--- are intended to be used in custom actions. Refer to the respective function documentation for example use cases.
---
--- The functions that take `action(s)` as input typically are |telescope.actions| that lever the
--- `action_state.selected_entry`. In particular, `action_utils.with_{entries, selection, selections}`
--- intermittently override the `selected_entry` to perform the |telescope.actions| accordingly.
--- More generally, `actions` as referred to in |telescope.actions.utils| are functions are akin to the below example:
---
--- <pre>
---   local action_state = require "telescope.actions.state"
---   function(prompt_bufnr)
---     local entry = action_state.get_selected_entry()
---     -- lever entry for function
---     ...
---   end
--- </pre>

local action_state = require "telescope.actions.state"
local log = require "telescope.log"

local action_utils = {}

--- Apply `f` to the entries of the current picker and prompt.
--- - `f` takes (entry, index, row) as arguments.
--- - Notes:
---   - Mapped entries may include results not visible in the results popup.
---   - Indices are 1-indexed, whereas rows are 0-indexed.
--- - Warning: `map_entries` has no return value.
---   - The below example showcase how to collect results.
---
--- <pre>
--- Example Usage: collect entries in key-value table
---   local action_state = require "telescope.actions.state"
---   local action_utils = require "telescope.actions.utils"

--- Apply `f` to the multi selections of the current picker and return a table of mapped selections.
--- - `f` takes (selection, selection_index) as arguments
