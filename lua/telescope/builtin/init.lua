---@tag telescope.builtin

---@brief [[
--- Telescope Builtins is a collection of community maintained pickers to support common workflows. It can be used as
--- reference when writing PRs, Telescope extensions, your own custom pickers, or just as a discovery tool for all of
--- the amazing pickers already shipped with Telescope!
---
--- Any of these functions can just be called directly by doing:
---
--- :lua require('telescope.builtin').$NAME_OF_PICKER()
---
--- To use any of Telescope's default options or any picker-specific options, call your desired picker by passing a lua
--- table to the picker with all of the options you want to use. Here's an example with the live_grep picker:
---
--- <pre>
--- :lua require('telescope.builtin').live_grep({
---   prompt_title = 'find string in open buffers...',
---   grep_open_files = true
--- })
--- -- or with dropdown theme
--- :lua require('telescope.builtin').find_files(require('telescope.themes').get_dropdown{
---   previewer = false
--- })
--- </pre>
---
--- You can also pass default configurations to builtin pickers. These options will also be added if
--- the picker is executed with `Telescope find_files`.
---
--- <pre>
--- require("telescope").setup {
---   pickers = {
---     buffers = {
---       show_all_buffers = true,
---       sort_lastused = true,
---       theme = "dropdown",
---       previewer = false,
---       mappings = {
---         i = {
---           ["<c-d>"] = require("telescope.actions").delete_buffer,
---           -- or right hand side can also be the name of the action as string
---           ["<c-d>"] = "delete_buffer",
---         },
---         n = {
---           ["<c-d>"] = require("telescope.actions").delete_buffer,
---         }
---       }
---     }
---   }
--- }
--- </pre>
---
--- This will use the default configuration options. Other configuration options are still in flux at the moment
