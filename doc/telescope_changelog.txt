A lot of new and breaking changes here as we work to clean up the way users
can configure how telescope's windows are configured.

|telescope.setup()| has changed `layout_defaults` -> `layout_config`.
    This makes it so that the setup and the pickers share the same key,
    otherwise it is too confusing which key is for which.


`picker:find()` now has different values available for configuring the UI.
    All configuration for the layout must be passed in the key:
        `layout_config`.

    Previously, these keys were passed via `picker:find(opts)`, but should be
    passed via `opts.layout_config` now.
        - {height}
        - {width}
        - {prompt_position}
        - {preview_cutoff}

    These keys are removed:
        - {results_height}: This key is no longer valid. Instead, use `height`
          and the corresponding `preview_*` options for the layout strategy to
          get the correct results height. This simplifies the configuration
          for many of the existing strategies.

        - {results_width}: This key actually never did anything. It was
          leftover from some hacking that I had attempted before. Instead you
          should be using something like the `preview_width` configuration
          option for |layout_strategies.horizontal()|

    You should get error messages when you try and use any of the above keys now.
