This is one of our largest breaking changes thus far, so I (TJ) am adding some
information here so that you can more easily update (without having to track
down the commit, etc.).

The goal of these breaking changes is to greatly simplify the way
configuration for layouts happen. This should make it much easier to configure
each picker, layout_strategy, and more. Please report any bugs or behavior
that is broken / confusing upstream and we can try and make the configuration
better.

|telescope.setup()| has changed `layout_defaults` -> `layout_config`.
    This makes it so that the setup and the pickers share the same key,
    otherwise it is too confusing which key is for which.


`picker:find()` now has different values available for configuring the UI.
    All configuration for the layout must be passed in the key:
        `layout_config`.

    Previously, these keys were passed via `picker:find(opts)`, but should be
    passed via `opts.layout_config` now.
        - {height}
        - {width}
        - {prompt_position}
        - {preview_cutoff}

    These keys are removed:
        - {results_height}: This key is no longer valid. Instead, use `height`
          and the corresponding `preview_*` options for the layout strategy to
          get the correct results height. This simplifies the configuration
          for many of the existing strategies.

        - {results_width}: This key actually never did anything. It was
          leftover from some hacking that I had attempted before. Instead you
          should be using something like the `preview_width` configuration
          option for |layout_strategies.horizontal()|

    You should get error messages when you try and use any of the above keys now.

Small breaking change regarding `shorten_path` and `hide_filename`.
This allows to configure path displays on a global level and offers a way for
extension developers to make use of the same configuration, offering a better
overall experience.

The new way to configure to configure path displays is with:
    `path_display`: It is a table and accepts multiple values:
        - "hidden"    hide file names
        - "tail"      only display the file name, and not the path
        - "absolute"  display absolute paths
        - "shorten"   only display the first character of each directory in
                      the path
    see |telescope.defaults.path_display|

Example would be for a global configuration:
  require("telescope").setup{
    defaults = {
      path_display = {
        "shorten",
        "absolute",
      },
    }
  }

You can also still pass this to a single builtin call:
    require("telescope.builtin").find_files {
      path_display = { "shorten" }
    }

For extension developers there is a new util function that can be used to
display a path:
    local filename = utils.transform_path(opts, entry.filename)
