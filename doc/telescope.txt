Telescope.nvim is a plugin for fuzzy finding and neovim. It helps you search,
filter, find and pick things in Lua.

telescope.extensions()                                *telescope.extensions()*
        Use telescope.extensions to reference any extensions within your
        configuration.
 While the docs currently generate this as a function,
        it's actually a table. Sorry.


telescope.load_extension({name})                  *telescope.load_extension()*
        Load an extension.

        Parameters: ~
            {name} (string)  Name of the extension


telescope.register_extension({mod})           *telescope.register_extension()*
        Register an extension. To be used by plugin authors.

        Parameters: ~
            {mod} (table)  Module


telescope.setup({opts})                                    *telescope.setup()*
        Setup function to be run by user. Configures the defaults, extensions

        and other aspects of telescope.

        Parameters: ~
            {opts} (table)  Configuration opts. Keys: defaults, extensions

                                                             *telescope.builtin*

A collection of builtin pickers for telesceope.

Meant for both example and for easy startup.

Any of these functions can just be called directly by doing:

:lua require('telescope.builtin').$NAME()

This will use the default configuration options.
  Other configuration options are still in flux at the moment

builtin.live_grep()                                      *builtin.live_grep()*
        Live grep means grep as you type.
