telescope.setup({opts})                                    *telescope.setup()*
    Setup function to be run by user. Configures the defaults, extensions and
    other aspects of telescope.


    Valid keys for {opts.defaults}

                                                *telescope.defaults.border*
    border: ~
        Boolean defining if borders are added to Telescope windows.

        Default: true

                                          *telescope.defaults.cache_picker*
    cache_picker: ~
        This field handles the configuration for picker caching.
        By default it is a table, with default values (more below).
        To disable caching, set it to false.

        Caching preserves all previous multi selections and results and
        therefore may result in slowdown or increased RAM occupation
        if too many pickers (`cache_picker.num_pickers`) or entries
        ('cache_picker.limit_entries`) are cached.

        Fields:
          - num_pickers:      The number of pickers to be cached.
                              Set to -1 to preserve all pickers of your session.
                              If passed to a picker, the cached pickers with
                              indices larger than `cache_picker.num_pickers` will
                              be cleared.
                              Default: 1
          - limit_entries:    The amount of entries that will be written in the
                              Default: 1000


                                      *telescope.defaults.default_mappings*
    default_mappings: ~
        Not recommended to use except for advanced users.

        Will allow you to completely remove all of telescope's default maps
        and use your own.


                                 *telescope.defaults.dynamic_preview_title*
    dynamic_preview_title: ~
        Will change the title of the preview window dynamically, where it
        is supported. Means the preview window will for example show the
        full filename.

        Default: false

                                          *telescope.defaults.entry_prefix*
    entry_prefix: ~
        Prefix in front of each result entry. Current selection not included.

        Default: '  '

                                               *telescope.defaults.history*
    history: ~
          This field handles the configuration for prompt history.
          By default it is a table, with default values (more below).
          To disable history, set it to false.

          Currently mappings still need to be added, Example:
            mappings = {
              i = {
                ["<C-Down>"] = require('telescope.actions').cycle_history_next,
                ["<C-Up>"] = require('telescope.actions').cycle_history_prev,
              },
            },

          Fields:
            - path:    The path to the telescope history as string.
                       default: stdpath("data")/telescope_history
            - limit:   The amount of entries that will be written in the
                       history.
                       Warning: If limit is set to nil it will grown unbound.
                       default: 100
            - handler: A lua function that implements the history.
                       This is meant as a developer setting for extensions to
                       override the history handling, e.g.,
                       https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-smart-history.nvim,
                       which allows context sensitive (cwd + picker) history.

                       Default:
                       require('telescope.actions.history').get_simple_history


                                         *telescope.defaults.layout_config*
    layout_config: ~
        Determines the default configuration values for layout strategies.
        See |telescope.layout| for details of the configurations options for
        each strategy.

        Allows setting defaults for all strategies as top level options and
        for overriding for specific options.
        For example, the default values below set the default width to 80% of
        the screen width for all strategies except 'center', which has width
        of 50% of the screen width.

        Default: {
          center = {
            preview_cutoff = 40
          },
          cursor = {
            preview_cutoff = 40
          },
          height = 0.9,
          horizontal = {
            preview_cutoff = 120,
            prompt_position = "bottom"
          },
          vertical = {
            preview_cutoff = 40
          },
          width = 0.8
        }


                                       *telescope.defaults.layout_strategy*
    layout_strategy: ~
        Determines the default layout of Telescope pickers.
        See |telescope.layout| for details of the available strategies.

        Default: 'horizontal'

                                              *telescope.defaults.mappings*
    mappings: ~
        Your mappings to override telescope's default mappings.

        Format is:
        {
          mode = { ..keys }
        }

        where {mode} is the one character letter for a mode
        ('i' for insert, 'n' for normal).

        For example:

        mappings = {
          i = {
            ["<esc>"] = require('telescope.actions').close,
          },
        }


        To disable a keymap, put [map] = false
          So, to not map "<C-n>", just put

            ...,
            ["<C-n>"] = false,
            ...,

          Into your config.


        otherwise, just set the mapping to the function that you want it to
        be.

            ...,
            ["<C-i>"] = require('telescope.actions').select_default,
            ...,

        If the function you want is part of `telescope.actions`, then you can
        simply give a string.
          For example, the previous option is equivalent to:

            ...,
            ["<C-i>"] = "select_default",
            ...,

        You can also add other mappings using tables with `type = "command"`.
          For example:

            ...,
            ["jj"] = { "<esc>", type = "command" },
            ["kk"] = { "<cmd>echo \"Hello, World!\"<cr>", type = "command" },)
            ...,


                                          *telescope.defaults.path_display*
    path_display: ~
        Determines how file paths are displayed

        path_display can be set to an array with a combination of:
        - "hidden"    hide file names
        - "tail"      only display the file name, and not the path
        - "absolute"  display absolute paths
        - "shorten"   only display the first character of each directory in
                      the path

        You can also specify the number of characters of each directory name
        to keep by setting `path_display.shorten = num`.
          e.g. for a path like
            `alpha/beta/gamma/delta.txt`
          setting `path_display.shorten = 1` will give a path like:
            `a/b/g/delta.txt`
          Similarly, `path_display.shorten = 2` will give a path like:
            `al/be/ga/delta.txt`

        path_display can also be set to 'hidden' string to hide file names

        path_display can also be set to a function for custom formatting of
        the path display. Example:

            -- Format path as "file.txt (path\to\file\)"
            path_display = function(opts, path)
              local tail = require("telescope.utils").path_tail(path)
              return string.format("%s (%s)", tail, path)
            end,

        Default: {}

                                         *telescope.defaults.prompt_prefix*
    prompt_prefix: ~
        Will be shown in front of the prompt.

        Default: '> '

                                       *telescope.defaults.scroll_strategy*
    scroll_strategy: ~
        Determines what happens you try to scroll past view of the picker.

        Available options are:
        - "cycle" (default)
        - "limit"

                                       *telescope.defaults.selection_caret*
    selection_caret: ~
        Will be shown in front of the selection.

        Default: '> '

                                    *telescope.defaults.selection_strategy*
    selection_strategy: ~
        Determines how the cursor acts after each sort iteration.

        Available options are:
        - "reset" (default)
        - "follow"
        - "row"
        - "closest"

                                      *telescope.defaults.sorting_strategy*
    sorting_strategy: ~
        Determines the direction "better" results are sorted towards.

        - "descending" (default)
        - "ascending"

telescope.extensions()                                *telescope.extensions()*
    Use telescope.extensions to reference any extensions within your
    configuration.
    While the docs currently generate this as a function, it's actually a
    table. Sorry.




================================================================================
                                                             *telescope.command*

Telescope commands can be called through two apis, the lua api and the viml
api.

The lua api is the more direct way to interact with Telescope, as you directly
call the lua functions that Telescope defines. It can be called in a lua file
using commands like:
`require("telescope.builtin").find_files({hidden=true, layout_config={prompt_position="top"}})`
If you want to use this api from a vim file you should prepend `lua` to the
command, as below:
`lua require("telescope.builtin").find_files({hidden=true, layout_config={prompt_position="top"}})`
If you want to use this api from a neovim command line you should prepend
`:lua` to the command, as below:
`:lua require("telescope.builtin").find_files({hidden=true, layout_config={prompt_position="top"}})`

The viml api is more indirect, as first the command must be parsed to the
relevant lua equivalent, which brings some limitations. The viml api can be
called using commands like:
`:Telescope find_files hidden=true layout_config={"prompt_position":"top"}`
This involves setting options using an `=` and using viml syntax for lists and
dictionaries when the corresponding lua function requires a table.

One limitation of the viml api is that there can be no spaces in any of the
options. For example, if you want to use the `cwd` option for `find_files` to
specify that you only want to search within the folder `/foo bar/subfolder/`
you could not do that using the viml api, as the path name contains a space.
Similarly, you could NOT set the `prompt_position` to `"top"` using the
following command:
`:Telescope find_files layout_config={ "prompt_position" : "top" }`
as there are spaces in the option.



================================================================================
                                                             *telescope.builtin*

Telescope Builtins is a collection of community maintained pickers to support
common workflows. It can be used as reference when writing PRs, Telescope
extensions, your own custom pickers, or just as a discovery tool for all of the
amazing pickers already shipped with Telescope!

Any of these functions can just be called directly by doing:

:lua require('telescope.builtin').$NAME_OF_PICKER()

To use any of Telescope's default options or any picker-specific options, call
your desired picker by passing a lua table to the picker with all of the
options you want to use. Here's an example with the live_grep picker:

:lua require('telescope.builtin').live_grep({
  prompt_title = 'find string in open buffers...',
  grep_open_files = true
})
-- or with dropdown theme
:lua require('telescope.builtin').find_files(require('telescope.themes').get_dropdown{
  previewer = false
})

You can also pass default configurations to builtin pickers. These options will
also be added if the picker is executed with `Telescope find_files`.

require("telescope").setup {
  pickers = {
    buffers = {
      show_all_buffers = true,
      sort_lastused = true,
      theme = "dropdown",
      previewer = false,
      mappings = {
        i = {
          ["<c-d>"] = require("telescope.actions").delete_buffer,
          -- or right hand side can also be the name of the action as string
          ["<c-d>"] = "delete_buffer",
        },
        n = {
          ["<c-d>"] = require("telescope.actions").delete_buffer,
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

This will use the default configuration options. Other configuration options
are still in flux at the moment

Themes are ways to combine several elements of styling together.

They are helpful for managing the several differnt UI aspects for telescope and
provide a simple interface for users to get a particular "style" of picker.

themes.get_dropdown()                                  *themes.get_dropdown()*
    Dropdown style theme.

    Usage:

        `local builtin = require('telescope.builtin')`
        `local themes = require('telescope.themes')`
        `builtin.find_files(themes.get_dropdown())`



themes.get_cursor()                                      *themes.get_cursor()*
    Cursor style theme.

    Usage:

        `local builtin = require('telescope.builtin')`
        `local themes = require('telescope.themes')`
        `builtin.lsp_code_actions(themes.get_cursor())`



themes.get_ivy()                                            *themes.get_ivy()*
    Ivy style theme.

    Usage:

        `local builtin = require('telescope.builtin')`
        `local themes = require('telescope.themes')`
        `builtin.find_files(themes.get_ivy())`




================================================================================
                                                              *telescope.layout*

Layout strategies are different functions to position telescope.

All layout strategies are functions with the following signature:

  function(picker, columns, lines, layout_config)
    -- Do some calculations here...
    return {
      preview = preview_configuration
      results = results_configuration,
      prompt = prompt_configuration,
    }
  end

  Parameters: ~
    - picker        : A Picker object. (docs coming soon)
    - columns       : (number) Columns in the vim window
    - lines         : (number) Lines in the vim window
    - layout_config : (table) The configuration values specific to the picker.


This means you can create your own layout strategy if you want! Just be aware
for now that we may change some APIs or interfaces, so they may break if you
create your own.

A good method for creating your own would be to copy one of the strategies that
most resembles what you want from
"./lua/telescope/pickers/layout_strategies.lua" in the telescope repo.


layout_strategies.horizontal()                *layout_strategies.horizontal()*
    Horizontal layout has two columns, one for the preview and one for the
    prompt and results.

Provides "resolver functions" to allow more customisable inputs for options.

resolver.resolve_height()                          *resolver.resolve_height()*
    Converts input to a function that returns the height. The input must take
    one of four forms:
    1. 0 <= number < 1
       This means total height as a percentage.
    2. 1 <= number
       This means total height as a fixed number.
    3. function
       Must have signature: function(self, max_columns, max_lines): number
    4. table of the form: {padding = `foo`}
       where `foo` has one of the previous three forms.
       The height is then set to be the remaining space after padding. For
       example, if the window has height 50, and the input is {padding = 5}, 
       the height returned will be `40 = 50 - 2*5`

    The returned function will have signature: function(self, max_columns,
    max_lines): number



resolver.resolve_width()                            *resolver.resolve_width()*
    Converts input to a function that returns the width. The input must take

    1. 0 <= number < 1
       This means total width as a percentage.
    2. 1 <= number

       Must have signature: function(self, max_columns, max_lines): number
    4. table of the form: {padding = `foo`}
       where `foo` has one of the previous three forms.
       The width is then set to be the remaining space after padding. For
       example, if the window has width 100, and the input is {padding = 5}, 
       the width returned will be `90 = 100 - 2*5`

Telescope action sets are used to provide an interface for managing actions
that all primarily do the same thing, but with slight tweaks.

For example, when editing files you may want it in the current split, a
vertical split, etc. Instead of making users have to overwrite EACH of those
every time they want to change this behavior, they can instead replace the
`set` itself and then it will work great and they're done.

action_set.shift_selection({prompt_bufnr}, {change})*action_set.shift_selection()*
    Move the current selection of a picker {change} rows. Handles not
    overflowing / underflowing the list.

    Select the current entry. This is the action set to overwrite common
    actions by the user.

    By default maps to editing a file.


    Parameters: ~

================================================================================
                                                          *telescope.previewers*

Provides a Previewer table that has to be implemented by each previewer. To
achieve this, this module also provides two wrappers that abstract most of the
work and make it really easy create new previewers.
  - `previewers.new_termopen_previewer`
  - `previewers.new_buffer_previewer`

Furthermore, there are a collection of previewers already defined which can be
used for every picker, as long as the entries of the picker provide the
necessary fields. The more important once are
  - `previewers.cat`
  - `previewers.vimgrep`
  - `previewers.qflist`
  - `previewers.vim_buffer_cat`
  - `previewers.vim_buffer_vimgrep`
  - `previewers.vim_buffer_qflist`

Previewers can be disabled for any builtin or custom picker by doing :Telescope
find_files previewer=false

previewers.Previewer()                                *previewers.Previewer()*
    This is the base table all previewers have to implement. It's possible to
    write a wrapper for this because most previewers need to have the same keys
    set. Examples of wrappers are:
      - `new_buffer_previewer`
      - `new_termopen_previewer`

    To create a new table do following:
      - `local new_previewer = Previewer:new(opts)`

    What `:new` expects is listed below

    The interface provides following set of functions. All of them, besides
    `new`, will be handled by telescope pickers.
    - `:new(opts)`
    - `:preview(entry, status)`
    - `:teardown()`
    - `:send_input(input)`
    - `:scroll_fn(direction)`

    `Previewer:new()` expects a table as input with following keys:
      - `setup` function(self): Will be called the first time preview will be 
        called.
      - `teardown` function(self): Will be called on cleanup.
      - `preview_fn` function(self, entry, status): Will be called each time a
        new entry was selected.
      - `title` function(self): Will return the static title of the previewer.
      - `dynamic_title` function(self, entry): Will return the dynamic title of
        the previewer. Will only be called when config value
        dynamic_preview_title is true.
      - `send_input` function(self, input): This is meant for 
        `termopen_previewer` and it can be used to send input to the terminal 
        application, like less.
      - `scroll_fn` function(self, direction): Used to make scrolling work.



previewers.new()                                            *previewers.new()*
    A shorthand for creating a new Previewer. The provided table will be
    forwarded to `Previewer:new(...)`



previewers.new_termopen_previewer()      *previewers.new_termopen_previewer()*
    Is a wrapper around Previewer and helps with creating a new
    `termopen_previewer`.

    It requires you to specify one table entry `get_command(entry, status)`.
    This `get_command` function has to return the terminal command that will be
    executed for each entry. Example:
      get_command = function(entry, status)
        return { 'bat', entry.path }
      end

    Additionally you can define:
    - `title` a static title for example "File Preview"
    - `dyn_title(self, entry)` a dynamic title function which gets called when
      config value `dynamic_preview_title = true`

    It's an easy way to get your first previewer going and it integrates well
    with `bat` and `less`. Providing out of the box scrolling if the command
    uses less.

    Furthermore, it will forward all `config.set_env` environment variables to
    that terminal process.

    While this interface is a good start, it was replaced with the way more
    flexible `buffer_previewer` and is now deprecated.



previewers.cat()                                            *previewers.cat()*
    Provides a `termopen_previewer` which has the ability to display files. It
    will always show the top of the file and has support for `bat`(prioritized)
    and `cat`. Each entry has to provide either the field `path` or `filename`
    in order to make this previewer work.

    The preferred way of using this previewer is like this
    `require('telescope.config').values.cat_previewer` This will respect user
    configuration and will use `buffer_previewers` in case it's configured that
    way.



previewers.vimgrep()                                    *previewers.vimgrep()*
    Provides a `termopen_previewer` which has the ability to display files at
    the provided line. It has support for `bat`(prioritized) and `cat`. Each
    entry has to provide either the field `path` or `filename` and a `lnum`
    field in order to make this previewer work.

    The preferred way of using this previewer is like this
    `require('telescope.config').values.grep_previewer` This will respect user
    configuration and will use `buffer_previewers` in case it's configured that
    way.



previewers.qflist()                                      *previewers.qflist()*
    Provides a `termopen_previewer` which has the ability to display files at
    the provided line or range. It has support for `bat`(prioritized) and
    `cat`. Each entry has to provide either the field `path` or `filename`,
    `lnum` and a `start` and `finish` range in order to make this previewer
    work.

    The preferred way of using this previewer is like this
    `require('telescope.config').values.qflist_previewer` This will respect
    user configuration and will use buffer previewers in case it's configured
    that way.



previewers.new_buffer_previewer()          *previewers.new_buffer_previewer()*
    An interface to instantiate a new `buffer_previewer`. That means that the
    content actually lives inside a vim buffer which enables us more control
    over the actual content. For example, we can use `vim.fn.search` to jump to
    a specific line or reuse buffers/already opened files more easily. This
    interface is more complex than `termopen_previewer` but offers more
    flexibility over your content. It was designed to display files but was
    extended to also display the output of terminal commands.

    In the following options, state table and general tips are mentioned to
    make your experience with this previewer more seamless.


    options:
      - `define_preview = function(self, entry, status)` (required) Is called
        for each selected entry, after each selection_move (up or down) and is
        meant to handle things like reading file, jump to line or attach a
        highlighter.
      - `setup = function(self)` (optional) Is called once at the beginning,
        before the preview for the first entry is displayed. You can return a
        table of vars that will be available in `self.state` in each
        `define_preview` call.
      - `teardown = function(self)` (optional) Will be called at the end, when
        the picker is being closed and is meant to cleanup everything that was
        allocated by the previewer. The `buffer_previewer` will automatically
        cleanup all created buffers. So you only need to handle things that
        were introduced by you.
      - `keep_last_buf = true` (optional) Will not delete the last selected
        buffer. This would allow you to reuse that buffer in the select action.
        For example, that buffer can be opened in a new split, rather than
        recreating that buffer in an action. To access the last buffer number: 
        `require('telescope.state').get_global_key("last_preview_bufnr")`
      - `get_buffer_by_name = function(self, entry)` Allows you to set a unique
        name for each buffer. This is used for caching purpose.
        `self.state.bufname` will be nil if the entry was never loaded or the
        unique name when it was loaded once. For example, useful if you have
        one file but multiple entries. This happens for grep and lsp builtins.
        So to make the cache work only load content if `self.state.bufname ~=
        entry.your_unique_key`
      - `title` a static title for example "File Preview"
      - `dyn_title(self, entry)` a dynamic title function which gets called 
        when config value `dynamic_preview_title = true`

    `self.state` table:
      - `self.state.bufnr` Is the current buffer number, in which you have to
        write the loaded content. Don't create a buffer yourself, otherwise
        it's not managed by the buffer_previewer interface and you will
        probably be better off writing your own interface.
      - self.state.winid Current window id. Useful if you want to set the
        cursor to a provided line number.
      - self.state.bufname Will return the current buffer name, if
        `get_buffer_by_name` is defined. nil will be returned if the entry was
        never loaded or when `get_buffer_by_name` is not set.

    Tips:
      - If you want to display content of a terminal job, use: 
        `require('telescope.previewers.utils').job_maker(cmd, bufnr, opts)`
          - `cmd` table: for example { 'git', 'diff', entry.value }
          - `bufnr` number: in which the content will be written
          - `opts` table: with following keys
            - `bufname` string: used for cache
            - `value` string: used for cache
            - `mode` string: either "insert" or "append". "insert" is default
            - `env` table: define environment variables. Example:
              - `{ ['PAGER'] = '', ['MANWIDTH'] = 50 }`
            - `cwd` string: define current working directory for job
            - `callback` function(bufnr, content): will be called when job is
              done. Content will be nil if job is already loaded. So you can do
              highlighting only the first time the previewer is created for
              that entry. Use the returned `bufnr` and not `self.state.bufnr`
              in callback, because state can already be changed at this point
              in time.
      - If you want to attach a highlighter use:
        - `require('telescope.previewers.utils').highlighter(bufnr, ft)`
          - This will prioritize tree sitter highlighting if available for 
            environment and language.
        - `require('telescope.previewers.utils').regex_highlighter(bufnr, ft)`
        - `require('telescope.previewers.utils').ts_highlighter(bufnr, ft)`
      - If you want to use `vim.fn.search` or similar you need to run it in 
        that specific buffer context. Do
          vim.api.nvim_buf_call(bufnr, function()
            -- for example `search` and `matchadd`
          end)
        to achieve that.
      - If you want to read a file into the buffer it's best to use 
        `buffer_previewer_maker`. But access this function with 
        `require('telescope.config').values.buffer_previewer_maker` because it
        can be redefined by users.



previewers.buffer_previewer_maker({filepath}, {bufnr}, {opts})*previewers.buffer_previewer_maker()*
    A universal way of reading a file into a buffer previewer. It handles async
    reading, cache, highlighting, displaying directories and provides a
    callback which can be used, to jump to a line in the buffer.


    Parameters: ~
        {filepath} (string)  String to the filepath, will be expanded
        {bufnr}    (number)  Where the content will be written
        {opts}     (table)   keys: `use_ft_detect`, `bufname` and `callback`


previewers.vim_buffer_cat()                      *previewers.vim_buffer_cat()*
    A previewer that is used to display a file. It uses the `buffer_previewer`
    interface and won't jump to the line. To integrate this one into your own
    picker make sure that the field `path` or `filename` is set for each entry.
    The preferred way of using this previewer is like this
    `require('telescope.config').values.file_previewer` This will respect user
    configuration and will use `termopen_previewer` in case it's configured
    that way.



previewers.vim_buffer_vimgrep()              *previewers.vim_buffer_vimgrep()*
    A previewer that is used to display a file and jump to the provided line.
    It uses the `buffer_previewer` interface. To integrate this one into your
    own picker make sure that the field `path` or `filename` and `lnum` is set
    in each entry. If the latter is not present, it will default to the first
    line. The preferred way of using this previewer is like this
    `require('telescope.config').values.grep_previewer` This will respect user
    configuration and will use `termopen_previewer` in case it's configured
    that way.



previewers.vim_buffer_qflist()                *previewers.vim_buffer_qflist()*
    Is the same as `vim_buffer_vimgrep` and only exist for consistency with
    `term_previewers`.

    The preferred way of using this previewer is like this
    `require('telescope.config').values.qflist_previewer` This will respect
    user configuration and will use `termopen_previewer` in case it's
    configured that way.



previewers.git_branch_log()                      *previewers.git_branch_log()*
    A previewer that shows a log of a branch as graph



previewers.git_stash_diff()                      *previewers.git_stash_diff()*
    A previewer that shows a diff of a stash



previewers.git_commit_diff_to_parent()*previewers.git_commit_diff_to_parent()*
    A previewer that shows a diff of a commit to a parent commit.
    The run command is `git --no-pager diff SHA^! -- $CURRENT_FILE`

    The current file part is optional. So is only uses it with bcommits.



previewers.git_commit_diff_to_head()    *previewers.git_commit_diff_to_head()*
    A previewer that shows a diff of a commit to head.
    The run command is `git --no-pager diff --cached $SHA -- $CURRENT_FILE`

    The current file part is optional. So is only uses it with bcommits.



previewers.git_commit_diff_as_was()      *previewers.git_commit_diff_as_was()*
    A previewer that shows a diff of a commit as it was.
    The run command is `git --no-pager show $SHA:$CURRENT_FILE` or `git
    --no-pager show $SHA`



previewers.git_commit_message()              *previewers.git_commit_message()*
    A previewer that shows the commit message of a diff.
    The run command is `git --no-pager log -n 1 $SHA`



previewers.git_file_diff()                        *previewers.git_file_diff()*
    A previewer that shows the current diff of a file. Used in git_status.
    The run command is `git --no-pager diff $FILE`



previewers.display_content()                    *previewers.display_content()*
    A deprecated way of displaying content more easily. Was written at a time,
    where the buffer_previewer interface wasn't present. Nowadays it's easier
    to just use this. We will keep it around for backwards compatibility
    because some extensions use it. It doesn't use cache or some other clever
    tricks.

                                                     *telescope.actions.history*

A base implementation of a prompt history that provides a simple history and
can be replaced with a custom implementation.

For example: We provide a extension for a smart history that uses sql.nvim to
map histories to metadata, like the calling picker or cwd.

So you have a history for:
- find_files project_1
- grep_string project_1
- live_grep project_1
- find_files project_2
- grep_string project_2
- live_grep project_2
- etc

See github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-smart-history.nvim
